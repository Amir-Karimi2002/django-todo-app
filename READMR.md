# My Django To-Do App

Welcome! This is a fully functional To-Do List application I built from scratch to practice and showcase my backend development skills with Python and Django.

### About This Project

I built this project as a core piece of my portfolio to master the fundamentals of web development. The goal was to go beyond a simple script and create a real, multi-user web application with a secure authentication system, a database, and a clean, interactive frontend. It was a fantastic learning experience where I tackled everything from database design to user interface styling.

### What Can It Do? ðŸš€

This isn't just a simple checklist. Here are the key features I implemented:

* **Secure User Accounts:** Users can register for a new account and log in securely. The app keeps every user's task list completely private.
* **Full Task Management (CRUD):** You can easily **C**reate new tasks, **R**ead your list, **U**pdate tasks (e.g., mark them as complete or edit the title), and **D**elete them.
* **Clean, Modern UI:** The interface is styled with Bootstrap 5 to be responsive and easy to use on any device.
* **User-Specific Experience:** The app greets you by name and always knows which tasks belong to you.

### My Tech Stack ðŸ’»

* **Backend:** Python, Django
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5
* **Database:** SQLite3
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

### What's Next?

I'm proud of how this project turned out, but I'm always thinking about what's next. Some ideas for future improvements include:
* Deploying the application to a live server.
* Adding a search/filter functionality for tasks.
* Implementing email notifications for task due dates.

Thanks for checking out my project!
